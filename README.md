# voting-dapp

i had some errors when setting up ethers library. but i fixed it, i was mixing the nomic labs and nomics foundation plugins for ethers v5 and ethers v6, since it has been long i wrote this.

since i am done with writing my voting contract and the deployment script, i am trying to setup for bsc, since i have more bnb in hand. but let me work with testnet first. so, would edit the hardhard.config.js file for that.
