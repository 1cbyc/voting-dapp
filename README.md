# voting-dapp

i had some errors when setting up ethers library. but i fixed it, i was mixing the nomic labs and nomics foundation plugins for ethers v5 and ethers v6, since it has been long i wrote this.

since i am done with writing my voting contract and the deployment script, i am trying to setup for bsc, since i have more bnb in hand. but let me work with testnet first. so, would edit the hardhard.config.js file for that.

will continue later. i stopped at where i ran this:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsctestnet
```
trying to fix this since it is not connecting to bsc testnet.

having tested some other rpc, i had to settle for this one `https://bsc-testnet.public.blastapi.io`. anyways, i am gonn' fund my testnet bal then get back to work. funded the wallet with 0.3bnb, we should be good to go.
